# 🌱 Crop and Weed Detection using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Crop and Weed Detection** project leverages **Machine Learning and Computer Vision** techniques to distinguish between **crops and weeds** in agricultural fields. The goal is to assist farmers in **automating weed identification**, optimizing herbicide usage, and improving crop yield through **precision agriculture**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Image Processing**: Uses **OpenCV** and **Deep Learning** to analyze agricultural images.  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify crops and weeds.  
- **Dataset Handling**: Preprocessing of images with data augmentation techniques.  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Model optimized for deployment on **edge devices** like Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** analyzed for effectiveness.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep Learning)  
- **OpenCV** (Image Processing)  
- **NumPy, Pandas** (Data Handling)  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development Environment)
