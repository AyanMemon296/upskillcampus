Predicting the Lifetime of a Bearing in Manufacturing Industry
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of bearings in manufacturing machinery using Machine Learning and Data Science techniques. Bearings are crucial components in industrial equipment, and their failure can lead to costly downtime and maintenance issues. By leveraging sensor data (e.g., vibration, temperature, load variations) and predictive modeling, this project aims to provide early failure detection and optimized maintenance schedules.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system that can:

Analyze bearing sensor data to identify failure patterns.
Accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of bearings.
Reduce unexpected breakdowns and optimize maintenance schedules.
Improve operational efficiency in industrial settings.
Approach & Methodology
The project follows a data-driven approach using Machine Learning algorithms:

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Collected sensor data (vibration, temperature, and operational conditions).
Handled missing values, noise, and outliers in the dataset.
Feature Engineering

Extracted time-domain and frequency-domain features from sensor data.
Applied dimensionality reduction (PCA, Autoencoders) for optimal feature selection.
Model Selection & Training

Implemented Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTMs for RUL prediction.
Optimized hyperparameters using Grid Search & Cross-Validation.
Performance Evaluation

Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score to assess model accuracy.
Real-Time Deployment (Future Scope)

Designed a framework for real-time monitoring and failure predictions using Edge AI and Industrial IoT platforms.
